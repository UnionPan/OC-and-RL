# Optimal and learning control for robotics (ECE-9243 / ME-GY 7973)

This repository provides material used for the class **Optimal and learning control for robotics** (ECE-9243 / ME-GY 7973) taught at New York University by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti).
Anyone is free to use and  copy this material (at their own risk!), please reference the material if you use it.

## Working with python
We work with Python 2.7 - numpy, scipy and matlplotlib are recommended libraries to install (come with Anaconda by default). Most the material is given as Jupyter notebooks.

Anaconda is a straightforward, multi-platform, easy-to-use python distribution. It can be downloaded here https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and extensive documentation is available here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/

Jupyter (comes with default Anaconda installation) is a great way to create notebooks for python. A simple tutorial can be found here https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
